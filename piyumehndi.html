            <p>Mehndi, also known as henna, is a form of temporary body art that originated in ancient India. It is
                created by applying a paste made from the crushed leaves of the henna plant to the skin, where it leaves
                a stain that can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks.

                Mehndi designs are typically applied to the hands and feet, but can also be applied to other parts of
                the body. The designs range from simple, small patterns to elaborate and intricate works of art. They
                can be traditional or contemporary in style, and are often inspired by nature, with flowers and vines
                being popular motifs.

                Mehndi is commonly associated with special occasions and celebrations, such as weddings, festivals, and
                religious holidays. It is also used as a form of self-expression and body decoration. Many people enjoy
                the temporary nature of mehndi, as it allows them to try out different designs and styles without the
                commitment of a permanent tattoo.</p>
